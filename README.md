Project Description

In most industries, costs of inputs can be used to calculate a profitable price to charge for a product. In the insurance industry, their product is the "insurance policy", and the largest input is the cost of "claims" their customers file when they get into an accident. These costs are difficult to calculate for two reasons. First, they vary by customer; some customers have multiple claims over the life of their policy, others have none. Second, the total cost of the claims is not known until after an accident occurs, which is well after the policy has been priced and sold to the customer.

However, segments of customers may be more likely to cause accidents leading insurance companies to charge different prices to various groups to "out-segment" their competitors leading to adverse selection for the competitors who end up with a large number of high-risk and claim-prone customers.

Insurance companies tightly guard the algorithms that they use to price the policies of individual customers, but if we could provide a policy quote after observing our competitors quote, this would allow for an "instantaneous last mover" advantage. Several sites provide services of comparing quote and considerable variability is observed between competitors. At that point it is already too late to update your quote. Therefore, if we can predict competitors' dynamic quotes we can base our quote on those as well.

This project is a pilot study for an auto insurance company, Allstate. Afterwards, we will be able to comment on the feasibility of the project, and potential next steps.
